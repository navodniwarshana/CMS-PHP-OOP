### **Detailed Notes on MAC Protocols**
---

## **1. Overview**
- **Wireless networks share a common channel**, leading to **collisions**.
- **Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol** is a sublayer of the **data link layer** that regulates access to the shared channel.
- **Key Goals of MAC Protocols:**
  - **Maximize channel utilization**.
  - **Minimize transmission delays**.
  - **Ensure fairness** â€“ No node should wait too long to transmit.

---

## **2. Required Properties of MAC Protocols**
- **Discipline in transmission** â€“ Avoid simultaneous transmissions.
- **Efficient channel utilization** â€“ Prevent bandwidth wastage.
- **Fairness in access** â€“ No node should face **unfair delays**.
- **Support for multiple traffic types** â€“ Different applications require varying data rates.
- **Adaptability** â€“ Should handle **equipment failures & network changes**.

---

## **3. Wireless MAC Protocol Issues**
### **A. Hidden Terminal Problem**
- Occurs when **two nodes (A & C) transmit to a common receiver (B)**, but **A and C cannot detect each other**.
- **Effect:** Causes **collisions at B**, leading to **garbled data**.

### **B. Exposed Terminal Problem**
- Occurs when **Node A** refrains from transmitting to **Node D** because it senses another transmission from **Node B to C**.
- **Effect:** Causes **unnecessary delays**, leading to **inefficient bandwidth use**.

---

## **4. Types of MAC Protocols**
### **A. Fixed Assignment Schemes**
- **Also called "Circuit Switched Schemes"** â€“ Each user gets a **dedicated resource**.
- **Types:**
  1. **Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)**
  2. **Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)**
  3. **Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)**

#### **1. Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)**
- **Bandwidth is divided into frequency channels**.
- **Each user gets a fixed frequency band**.
- **Forward Link (Mobile â†’ Base Station) & Reverse Link (Base Station â†’ Mobile)**.
- **Pros:**
  - **Simple to implement**.
- **Cons:**
  - **Poor channel utilization** â€“ If a user is idle, bandwidth remains unused.

#### **2. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)**
- **Time slots are assigned to users** in a round-robin manner.
- **Nodes take turns transmitting**.
- **Unused slots remain idle**, leading to **wasted bandwidth**.
- **Pros:**
  - **Efficient if demand is predictable**.
- **Cons:**
  - **Idle time slots reduce efficiency**.

#### **3. Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)**
- **All users transmit at the same time** using **unique codes**.
- **Each signal is encoded and then decoded by the receiver**.
- **Pros:**
  - **Maximum channel utilization**.
- **Cons:**
  - **Expensive & complex** â€“ Requires specialized **encoding & decoding mechanisms**.

---

### **B. Random Assignment Schemes**
- **Nodes transmit at random times**, without fixed slots or channels.
- **Types:**
  1. **Pure ALOHA**
  2. **Slotted ALOHA**
  3. **Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)**
  4. **CSMA/CD (Collision Detection)**
  5. **CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance)**

#### **1. Pure ALOHA**
- **Nodes transmit whenever they have data**.
- **Collisions are frequent**, leading to **low efficiency**.
- **If no acknowledgment is received, the node retransmits after a random time**.

#### **2. Slotted ALOHA**
- **Time is divided into slots**.
- **Nodes can only transmit at the beginning of a slot**.
- **Improves efficiency compared to Pure ALOHA**, but **collisions can still occur**.

#### **3. Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)**
- **Nodes listen before transmitting**.
- **Two Types:**
  - **CSMA/CD (Collision Detection)**
  - **CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance)**

##### **CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)**
- **Used in wired networks (Ethernet)**.
- **Process:**
  - Node **checks if the channel is idle** before transmitting.
  - If the channel is busy, it **waits**.
  - If a **collision occurs**, the sender **stops transmission immediately**.
  - It **waits for a random time** before retransmitting.

##### **CSMA/CD in Wireless Networks**
- **Not effective** because:
  - **Wireless signals weaken** over distance.
  - **A node cannot detect its own collision**.
  - **Only the receiver notices the error** (due to a corrupted checksum).

##### **CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)**
- **Better suited for wireless networks**.
- **Prevents collisions by introducing a waiting time** before rechecking the channel.
- **If the channel is busy, the node waits longer** to avoid simultaneous transmissions.

---

### **C. Reservation-Based Schemes**
- **Nodes reserve the channel before transmission**.
- **Uses RTS/CTS (Request to Send / Clear to Send) messages**.
- **Example: Multiple Access Collision Avoidance (MACA)**.

#### **1. RTS/CTS Mechanism**
- **Sender (A) requests access** by sending an **RTS** to **Receiver (B)**.
- **Receiver (B) grants permission** by sending a **CTS**.
- **Other nodes defer their transmissions**, preventing collisions.

#### **2. Solving the Hidden Terminal Problem with MACA**
- **Node A sends an RTS to B**.
- **B responds with a CTS**.
- **Node C hears the CTS and refrains from transmitting**.
- **Collision is prevented at B**.

#### **3. Solving the Exposed Terminal Problem with MACA**
- **Node B sends an RTS to A**.
- **Node C ignores the RTS (since it is not the receiver)**.
- **A sends a CTS back to B**.
- **C can transmit independently to another node**.

---

### **Summary of MAC Protocols**
| **Type** | **Description** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|----------|----------------|----------|----------|
| **FDMA** | Assigns fixed frequency bands to users | Simple implementation | Poor channel utilization |

| **Pure ALOHA** | Nodes transmit randomly | Simple | High collision rate |
| **Slotted ALOHA** | Transmissions happen at fixed time slots | Reduces collisions compared to Pure ALOHA | Still suffers from collisions |
| **CSMA/CD** | Listens before transmitting, stops on collision | Reduces wasted bandwidth | Does not work well in wireless networks |
| **CSMA/CA** | Avoids collisions by introducing wait times | Works well in wireless | Can introduce delays |
| **RTS/CTS (MACA)** | Nodes reserve the channel before transmitting | Solves hidden & exposed terminal problems | Adds overhead to communication |
